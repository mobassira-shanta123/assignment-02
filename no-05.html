                    <strong><u>They have black whiskers on their face and legs to help them find their way through tall grass.</strong></u> They also use their big bushy tails to communicate messages with other foxes and to wrap up warm when they're sleeping!They're small enough to effectively move, hunt and hide in the under brush and other small spaces, but large enough to prey on animals smaller than them.Foxes are primarily nocturnal animals, which means they are active during the night, but they are often seen during the day too.Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards and female foxes are called vixens.</p>
